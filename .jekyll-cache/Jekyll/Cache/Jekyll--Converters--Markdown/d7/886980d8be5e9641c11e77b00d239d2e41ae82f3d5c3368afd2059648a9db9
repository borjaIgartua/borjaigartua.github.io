            <p>BBVA Chile launches first bank account on Facebook in Latin America</p>
            <p>Digital banking has grown by leaps and bounds around the world and in Chile as well. The possibility of transferring money and performing many other financial operations through ATMs, mobile telephones, computers and tablets via Internet, is now joined by an innovative bank account on Facebook, the first of its kind in Latin America.</p>
            <p>The new application, BBVA Link, which will start operating in Chile on March 3rd, will allow users to send, request and receive money directly through Facebook in just three steps, on a completely secure platform and no maintenance fees.</p>
            <p>Likewise, BBVA Link allows users to request money from the list of Facebook friends who have the BBVA Link application installed by simply selecting the person and stating the amount to be received.</p>
            <p>Security A key aspect of BBVA Link is its high security standards which are the same currently in use for all BBVA bank transactions. All transactions are made with high-security encrypted data embedded on BBVA servers. Therefore Link does not share any of its usersâ€™ financial information with Facebook or any other platform.</p>            
            <p>According to the BBVA Chile Business Development manager, Link is part of BBVAâ€™s strategy to lead the technological changes that are transforming the financial industry and to lead digital banking in Latin America.</p>
            <blockquote>
            BBVA Link responds to a new way of banking. Moving from a traditional form of banking to a digital business model is necessary to be competitive, offer more efficient, flexible and quality services and, ultimately, simplify peopleâ€™s lives</blockquote>
