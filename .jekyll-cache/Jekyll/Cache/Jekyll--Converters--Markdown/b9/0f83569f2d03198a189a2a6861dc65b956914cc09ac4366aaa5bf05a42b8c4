I"‚<p>After my first years I was ready for a new challenge and I joined Revival, a startup where I was in since the beginning. We were a team of five colleagues working in all aspects related to our application. At Revival I was not only the <strong>iOS developer</strong>, but also we worked together making decisions about the app usability, the product, new features, among others.</p>
