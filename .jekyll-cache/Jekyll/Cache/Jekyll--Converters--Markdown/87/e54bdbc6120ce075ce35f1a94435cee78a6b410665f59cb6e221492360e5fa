I"+<p>After five years as an iOS developer, I discovered that there were other paths to explore. By becoming a Trainer I wanted to learn all about what I didnâ€™t know. I was a Trainer for around <strong>two years</strong> and I can say that it was one of the most gratefull jobs I have ever done.</p>
