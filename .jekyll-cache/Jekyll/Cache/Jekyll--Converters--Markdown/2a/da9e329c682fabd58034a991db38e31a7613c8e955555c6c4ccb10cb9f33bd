I"«<p>Since its creation by Kent Beck,  TDD (Test-Driven Development) has spread and gained popularity. However, it is often wrongly applied and the teams that implement them face the common problems and end up giving up the task:<br /><br />â€¢ Usually we test what we shouldnâ€™t <br />â€¢ Tests are wrongly designed, so one test failed can have multiple reasons.<br />â€¢ Tests take too long to execute, making developers to skip them.<br />â€¢ We try to test everything instead of testing what needs to be test.<br />â€¢  It is not applied correctly to the particularities of iOS, Cocoa and Objective C.<br /><br />All these errors happen because development teams learn â€œhowâ€ about TDD but not â€œwhyâ€. There is only a way to change our habits, that is, practising new ones. That is why this course, which has been successfully taught in European and LATAM companies, is mainly practice and is based on an iOS app development.</p>
