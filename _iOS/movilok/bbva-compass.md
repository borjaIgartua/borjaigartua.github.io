              <blockquote>
                <p>BBVA Compass is a long-needed app that doesn’t disappoint. Its good, clean Windows Phone App-style UI matches the bank website’s blue and white color scheme perfectly. The app does everything you could want it to do, and so much more efficiently than going through the website on a phone. If you have the misfortune of banking with BBVA Compass (can you tell I love them?), don’t hesitate to grab the app today.</p>
