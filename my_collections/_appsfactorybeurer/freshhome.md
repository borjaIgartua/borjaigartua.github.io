            <p>Say goodbye to poor air quality! The "beurer FreshHome" app provides a pleasant and healthy indoor environment within your own four walls.</p>
            <p>Keep track of your indoor environment at home – wherever you happen to be!</p>
            <p>Set your own target ranges for your personal indoor environment with the “beurer FreshHome” app.</p>
            <p>As soon as the indoor environment moves beyond this range, you can activate your LR 500 air purifier – either at home or on the move – which is possible through the automatic transfer of the values to the app.</p>
            <p>Using your LR 500 air purifier in combination with the “beurer FreshHome" app means you are getting the most out of your device.</p>
            <p>How you benefit from linking the app with the Beurer air purifier:</p>
            <p>• Real-time assessment of the indoor air quality<br/>
                • Control your air purifier from anywhere: it can be activated or programmed, and you can set the timer, fan levels and other functions<br/>
                • Create a timed programme that automatically switches on the device according to your personal preferences<br/>
                • Analyse past air quality data<br/>
                • Improve air quality at home thanks to personalised tips for preventing “bad air”<br/>
